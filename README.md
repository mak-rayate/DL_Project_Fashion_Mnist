In this assignment, you will use the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). It consists of a training set of 60,000 images of fashion items with corresponding labels, and a test set of 10,000 images. The images have been normalised and centred. The dataset is frequently used in machine learning research, especially as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset.
